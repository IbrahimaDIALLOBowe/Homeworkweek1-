*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 

Mint offers one convenient place to their consumers: ‘‘All your money in one place.’’  

When Mint first started, it was not the first web-based money manager software. Among its competitors were: Quicken Online, Microsoft Money Online, Wesabe, and Geezeo. But Mint’s advantages were ease of setting up accounts; ease of categorizing expenses; and the ease of seeing the overall financial component of life-planning. Mint also offered a personal finance blog which included educational infographics and information on trends. Both have attracted a lot of social attention. According to one blogger: “Mint became to finances what ESPN is to sports.”    

According to Investmentjunkie.com, Mint’s advantages are the following: 

•	Mint shows all accounts in one place
•	Mint is a digital financial advisor [via its blog]
•	Mint helps simplify bill payments
•	Mint markets competitive credit cards
•	Mint markets third-party loans

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 

Mint “incorporate[s] machine learning in its design, making [the user’s] tasks more automated and […] more useful. […] Mint developers continue to take advantage of machine-learning technology (AI) to provide a smarter, more personalized, more automated experience. They’ve simplified the site’s overall design and become more proactive in encouraging users to actually improve their money management techniques instead of passively tracking their accounts.” 

 
 
## Landscape: 

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?: 

Mint is in the personal financial management industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?: 

A few innovations from Forbes Fintech 50 2020 list follow: 
 
•	 ‘‘Dave, a startup banking and budgeting app, offers users cash advances of up to $100 instead of hitting them with overdraft fees.

•	Acorns, which started as a “round-up” app that moved extra pennies from credit and debit card purchases into ETFs, has also added checking accounts and debit cards. 

•	Credit Karma, the original free credit score startup, has rolled out its own bank service: high yield FDIC-insured money market accounts.  

•	Significantly, none of [these] picks have bank charters themselves; instead, they’re part of a growing trend whereby digital innovators are partnering with little known FDIC-insured banks. 

•	[…] Newcomer Propel’s mobile app helps food stamp recipients check their benefit balances, load digital supermarket coupons, and even hunt for jobs and social services. First-timer Tally is aimed at consumers struggling to pay off credit card debt.’’  

Quite interestingly, in 2020, Fintechs are now not only working with the rich or with people who have income, but they also are innovating by working with those with low income or no income.  
 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?: 

The other major companies include: Forbes, Acorns, Affirm, Chime,  Credit Karma, Dave, Lively, MoneyLion, Nova Credit, Geezeo, and. Personal Capital.

Competing software apps include Dave, MoneyPatrol, Tiller Money, PocketSmith, Moneydance, and YNAB.
 
## Results
 
* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 

Mint offers a free, easy, cloud-based (online or mobile app) solution for non-financially savvy people to see the big picture related to their financial health, including easy access to their credit score. According to Investopedia, Mint was named the best free solution for home use in its list of “the 5 best accounting software of 2020.” 


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? 

Core metrics in this domain include product cost, number of users, ease of use, reputation, and functionality. Mint is free, used by millions, easy to use, and enjoys a good reputation due to its ease of use and intuitive graphical interface.



* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? 

Given its ranking above, Mint is tops in home accounting software.  Note, however, that some believe that Mint is in a period of neglect.  (cf. next question).

 
## Recommendations 

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!): 

Fastcompany states that the Mint app “exhibits severe symptoms of neglect.”  Some of the drawbacks of using Mint are: some issues with automatic synchronization with linked financial accounts; limitation on inclusion of investing activities, their management, and tracking ; miscategorization of many transactions, viewing and exporting records requiring hand-editing; and no capability to merge Mint and Turbotax . Other improvements needed are better customer service, capability to generate reports, and capability to reconcile accounts. To the extent possible (given that ads are a source of revenue), less intrusion of ads would be desirable . Finally, others have suggested the need to upgrade their Bill Pay feature to be able to break down subgroups in the app, to make easier manual tracking of expenses, to remove the rounding of all numbers, and to add the capability to separate income in budgets, ….  
“For all of Mint’s failures to evolve and improve, its core functionality -- putting your accounts in one free and easily scanned dashboard -- continues to be fundamentally useful. That was the ability that led Fast Company to call it “the Axe Body Spray of personal finance -- cool, fresh, and even sexy.” Any competitor will need to provide the same quick answers to “how much did I make?” and “where did I spend it?” before scaring Intuit out of its apathy.”  



 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?: 

Upgrading Mint’s functionality in these “areas of neglect” would make for a more robust app. However, some of the upgrades might result in a more complicated app which would be detrimental for the less financially savvy user. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 

Stackshare seems to indicate that Intuit, parent company of Mint, uses a huge number of technologies,  including 43 applications, 9 utilities, 37 devOps, and 6 business tools.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The Stackshare technologies above appear to have been proven successful for Mint’s parent company, Intuit.
